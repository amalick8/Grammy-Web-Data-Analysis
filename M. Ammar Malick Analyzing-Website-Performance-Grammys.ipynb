Post-split, bounce rate remained stable for Grammys.com (40% vs 42% pre-split) and was significantly lower for RecordingAcademy.com (34%). Pages per session stayed steady at 2, suggesting depth of visit was unaffected. However, average session duration dropped on Grammys.com from ~103s to ~83s, while RecordingAcademy.com users stayed longer (129s), indicating more sustained engagement on the latter.\n",

Drive cross-site traffic with embedded links and campaign tie-ins during nomination announcements (Nov) and other major music events."
